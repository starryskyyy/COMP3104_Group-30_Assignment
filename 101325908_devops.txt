While I was learning to develop programs, I have seen some information about Devops several times.
However, every time I saw something related to Devops, I always felt something like ambiguous feelings.
In my brain, the image that I can come up with when It comes to Devops is an abstract concept.
I want to make this concrete as I go through this course. I am looking forward to learn more deeper story about devops.
