Welcome to the text where all available information on George Brown College will be displayed!

A man named George Brown who was born in 1818 was a Scottish born Canadian politician. Brown was a strong believer when it came to public education.
In 1968, George Brown College opened its doors to little over 2,000 new students. 
We once provided courses in signwriting and watchmaking in addition to programmes in construction, early childhood education, dentistry services, and the culinary arts, all of which we still teach today. 
Unbelievably, we even offered a marine engineering curriculum to equip students for vocations at sea.
Since then, we now have more than 30,000 students enrolled full-time. People from all around the Greater Toronto Area, the nation, and the world attend George Brown to acquire the knowledge and practical experience necessary to excel in the workplace.
George Brown's size has more than doubled since 2004, and we've grown our international collaborations and relationships.
