Development and operations teams are no longer "siloed" under a DevOps approach. 
There are instances when these two teams are combined into one, where the engineers work across the whole application 
lifecycle—from development and test to deployment and operations—and acquire a variety of skills that are not specific to any one function.

There are many benefits of DevOps which will be listed below:

Speed - Move quickly so you can develop for clients more quickly, better adjust to shifting markets, and become more effective at generating business results. 
Your development and operations teams can accomplish these goals thanks to the DevOps approach. 
For instance, teams can take control of services and change them more quickly thanks to microservices and continuous delivery.
