What is Devops in the first place?

According to Wikipedia, 
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile way of working.

There are four Core Devops Principles:
1. Automation of the software development lifecycle
2. Collaboration and communication
3. Continuous improvement and minimization of waste
4. Hyperfocus on user needs with short feedback loops
