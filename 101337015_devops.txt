What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software
development and IT teams, so they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.
The term DevOps was formed by combining the words “development” and “operations” and
signifies a cultural shift that bridges the gap between development and operation teams, which
historically functioned in siloes.
