What is Devops in the first place?

According to Wikipedia, 
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile way of working.

There are four Core Devops Principles:
1. Automation of the software development lifecycle
2. Collaboration and communication
3. Continuous improvement and minimization of waste
4. Hyperfocus on user needs with short feedback loops

I think the reason why we need to learn devops is that
1. it helps in reducing the time for cycles of development
2. it helps to improve collaboration and communication of a team
3. it helps to increase efficiencies in general
4. it ensures that there is a reduction in rollbacks, failures of deployment
5. products' quality that came out with devops are generally excellent
6. It is a smart career option in the technical job market

Because of all those mentioned reasons, there is no much rational reasons to avoid learning devops.
