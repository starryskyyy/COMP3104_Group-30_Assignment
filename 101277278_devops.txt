What is DevOps:
A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.
What does DevOps mean for teams? DevOps enables formerly siloed roles—development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security—to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals faster.

The benefit of DevOps:
Teams that adopt DevOps culture, practices, and tools become high-performing, building better products faster for greater customer satisfaction. This improved collaboration and productivity is also integral to achieving business goals like these: Accelerating time to market, Adapting to the market and competition, Maintaining system stability and reliability, Improving the mean time to recovery.
